- ``git add``
> *This command updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit. It typically adds the current content of existing paths as a whole, but with some options it can also be used to add content with only part of the changes made to the working tree files applied, or remove paths that do not exist in the working tree anymore.*

- ``git commit``
> *Create a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the given log message describing the changes. The new commit is a direct child of HEAD, usually the tip of the current branch, and the branch is updated to point to it.*

- ``git status``
> *Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the current HEAD commit, paths that have differences between the working tree and the index file, and paths in the working tree that are not tracked by Git*

- ``git push``
> *Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary to complete the given refs.*

- ``git branch``
> *List, create, or delete branches*

- Forkkaaminen
> *"A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository. Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository." "When creating your public repository from a fork of someone's project, make sure to include a license file that determines how you want your project to be shared with others."*
