### **Ohjeet**

----

- ``git add``
> *The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant way—changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit.*

- ``git committiin``
> *Create a new commit containing the current contents of the index and the given log message describing the changes. The new commit is a direct child of HEAD, usually the tip of the current branch, and the branch is updated to point to it (unless no branch is associated with the working tree, in which case HEAD is "detached" as described in git-checkout.*

- ``git status`` -kertoo gitin nykyisen tilanteen ja mitä tiedostoja git ei huomioi.

- ``git push`` -tällä voit lähettää paikallisia tietoja githubiin.

- ``git branch`` -kertoo nykysein haarasi.

- Forkkaaminen
> *"A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the original “upstream” repository. Forks are often used to iterate on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository, such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to the upstream repository." "When creating your public repository from a fork of someone's project, make sure to include a license file that determines how you want your project to be shared with others."* https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo
